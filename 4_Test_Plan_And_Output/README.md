It takes various inputs from user like names, items, quantity, etc. And, this calculates bill amount with tax calculations as well and then produce a bill which can be provided to the customer. It also uses file handling to store the data of all previous bills and also has the ability to search for a customer's old bill by using their name. This system generates much faster bills as compared to other.
